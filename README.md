### Hi there 👋

- My name is Jingwen Wu, and I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at the University of Kentucky. My current research focuses on the relationship of modern communication technology and political outcomes, environmental policy, and China's foreign policy. I received my M.P.A. from Morehead State University and my B.A. from Central University for Nationalities in China.

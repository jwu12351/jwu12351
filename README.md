### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jingwen Wu, and I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Texas at Austin studying Political Science. In my research, I examine the relationship between modern communication technology and political outcomes, environmental policy, and foreign policy in China. I earned my M.P.A. degree from Morehead State University and my B.A. from Central University for Nationalities.
